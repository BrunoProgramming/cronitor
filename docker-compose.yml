# This is an example docker-compose file for exposing Cronitor on localhost port
# 4217 (= 8434 / 2, where 8434 is the default Cronitor port).  You should
# copy/write your own docker-compose file which suits your needs.
#
# You can use it for development/testing like this:
#
#    $ docker-compose build
#    $ docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml teststack
